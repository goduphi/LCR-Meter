# Design goal of the circuit
I was always fascinated by PCB fabrication and due to not having direct access to that I decided to make my wiring resemble PCB traces
to the best of abilities. This is not the best design as the solder joints might break if enough force is applied on them, but they are
strong enough to withstand quite a bit of impact.
